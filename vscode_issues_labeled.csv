Formatting error in python notebooks leading to crash,"
Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

I have been using Claude Sonnet 4 for writing this notebook but the changes it made are not correctly formatted (internally) due to which the markdowns of this notebook is not visible any more nor the cell outputs (Note: all the code is correctly formatted and visible). VSCode also keeps throwing an error that it is not responding and do I want to keep waiting, or close.
This is the second time I am encountering this and the first time I had to delete the notebook in order to solve it.
I have never faced this issue using Claude 3.7 Thinking so far even though I have used it a lot too so it likely an issue with Claude 4.
Since I am not able to see the markdowns at all now, I am not able to check which markdown cell is exactly causing it.

* is positioned wrongly, even though it has a beak
* its outline is cut off to the top making it look as if it goes outside of the window

Step to reproduce:
- Occurs during the unit test run
- It may not be easy but I hope developer will associate this with some was done in 101 that caused this.
- Switching back to 1.100.3 fixes it
- Test launch aborts with stack trace below
- The class react-dom is trying to access navigator.userAgent and navigator is undefined I guess.
```
  if (!foundDevTools && canUseDOM && window.top === window.self) {

    if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Chrome') > -1 && navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Edge') === -1 || navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Firefox') > -1) {

Taskbar icon appears to be incorrect,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Steps to reproduce are to open the latest version of VS Code Insiders. The normal VS Code Insiders icon in the taskbar has changed to an icon that resembles an atom. Closing and reopening VS Code Insiders does not change the behavior. The normal icon is still present in other places like the Start Menu and the VS Code window toolbar.

Searching the Terminal,"
Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

If at any time i press CTRL+F and type into the search bar inside the terminal to locate a string it will freeze the IDE, windows will indicate the IDE is not responding and prompt to close, waiting does not recover it. It always crashes after the 2nd letter in the search box. I upgraded to the latest VS Code and the same thing happened.

VS Code version: Code 1.101.0 (dfaf44141ea9deb3b4096f7cd6d24e00c147a4b1, 2025-06-11T15:00:50.123Z)

chat.mcp.enabled disabled due a non existing policy,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

After updating to the latest version. The mcp servers in setting.json and mcp.json cannot be started. After checking the setting. I got a message from code saying:
This setting cannot be applied because it is configured in the system policy.

Everything is working as expected in VS Code. This only happens with insiders.

User defined MCP servers are lost after June 2025 update  ,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

After VSC insiders updated to the June 2025 update on its own, I do not see the MCP servers I added and I cannot add them again to use them.
The settings.json file is correct but the servers are not loaded anymore.

Please help.

"`chat.mcp.enabled` unexpectedly ""managed by organization"" after VS Code Insiders update","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

The `chat.mcp.enabled` setting in VS Code Insiders has become disabled and is now indicated as ""managed by organization"" following a recent update. This occurred despite the user not being connected to any organization through their Windows or GitHub accounts, and the setting was user-configurable before the update.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51e028b6-8ab1-4b42-8cf5-24a4ae3a78ae)

**VS Code Insiders Version Details (Affected):**

*   **Version:** 1.102.0-insider (user setup)
*   **Commit:** 7e4e0f4e55d0d0a2a931aa4e0b7acc518e5da0dd
*   **Date:** 2025-06-13T05:04:03.051Z
*   **Electron:** 35.5.1
*   **ElectronBuildId:** 11727614
*   **Chromium:** 134.0.6998.205
*   **Node.js:** 22.15.1
*   **V8:** 13.4.114.21-electron.0
*   **OS:** Windows_NT x64 10.0.26100

**Previous VS Code Insiders Version (Unaffected):** 1.101.0.20250611

**Current Stable VS Code Version (Unaffected):** 1.101.0

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1.  Have VS Code Insiders version 1.101.0.20250611 installed with `chat.mcp.enabled` either enabled or user-configurable.
2.  Allow VS Code Insiders to auto-update to version 1.102.0.20250613.
3.  Open VS Code Insiders settings.
4.  Search for the setting `chat.mcp.enabled`.
5.  (Optional) Check the same setting in VS Code stable version 1.101.0 to observe it remains user-configurable.

**Expected Behavior:**

The `chat.mcp.enabled` setting should remain user-configurable in VS Code Insiders, allowing the user to enable or disable it as needed, consistent with its behavior in the stable release and previous Insiders versions.

**Actual Behavior:**

In VS Code Insiders 1.102.0.20250613, the `chat.mcp.enabled` setting is disabled (off) and is now labeled as ""managed by organization."" The user is unable to change this setting. This change in behavior occurred directly after the VS Code Insiders update, without any changes to the user's system or account affiliations.

**Potential Regression:**

This issue may be a regression related to or similar to the issue reported in GitHub issue #246585, where users also experienced settings becoming ""managed by organization"" unexpectedly.

**Additional Information:**

*   The user's Windows operating system is not part of an organization.
*   The user's GitHub account is not connected to an organization that would manage VS Code settings.
*   This issue was not present in the previous VS Code Insiders version (1.101.0.20250611).
*   The `chat.mcp.enabled` setting is still working correctly and is user-configurable in the regular (stable) VS Code version 1.101.0.
*   The Model Context Protocol (MCP) support in VS Code is a preview feature.

**Impact:**

The user has lost the ability to enable and utilize MCP server functionalities within VS Code Insiders, which they were previously able to configure and can still configure in the stable version.

When using Doxygen style comments to describe a function which has in/out parameters and using the format supported by Doxygen, i.e. ""[in,out]"" (https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdparam), VS Code hover tooltip shows in/out parameters twice:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/990d29a3-6915-46d5-95b3-43b480055bb6)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef470b73-8ba3-463f-ac0d-51bf819600e7)

Whereas when we use non-standard ""[inout]"" format, VS Code correctly displays each parameter once and recognizes this format: syntax coloring puts ""inout"" in blue whereas it does not recognize any other random direction such as ""wrongdir"":

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eecb0639-d4a9-4642-a852-6b67d1e9fc00)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/005b666b-a479-4a03-a4b5-1ea22f8e60d1)

Is there a reason for displaying the parameter twice? If not, please fix VS Code to display it once. This is better than using non-standard [inout] format which will most likely not be accepted by other tools.

I would like to ask for a way to ""Always allow in this session"" option for terminal commands. I understand this is risky, esp. for `npm`, but maybe it could work by literally only allowing that exact command invocation.

Rationale: in a longer session I am repeatedly being asked for the same invocation over and over.

# Description
I would like the ability to track if the primary sidebar, secondary sidebar and panel are visible. This is currently only possible through ""when"" clauses but not through the extension API.

# Use Case
I need this to track context for an AI extension which uses the visible state of the IDE as context, for this I need to know the state of the display, and in turn need to know if the panels are open or not.

This has already been raised in #186581, but was not taken up. I would like to re-raise this feature request.",https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251274,*duplicate

I think it would be great if the terminal name could be more descriptive around why it was created and not ""Copilot"". I also feel the icon could maybe be just the normal icon but decorated?

Opening folder or file on network share from terminal,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

From windows terminal execute this command and a folder (or file) opens in VS Code correctly:
```code -n ""C:\testfolder""```

However opening a folder or a file on a network share does not work.
These commands fail:
```code -n ""N:\testfolder""```
```code -n ""N:\testfile.txt""```

When I try to open an existing file, Code tries to create a new empty file on that location?
When i try to save this new file I see this error message:

Ability to programmatically assign documents to open in a workspace before it's opened,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->

I'm working on the [Microsoft C# DevKit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-c-sharp-dev-kit) VS Code extension. In particular, I'm trying to improve the experience for users who create project templates.
 
We have a flow like this:

1. User opens VS Code with no open folder
2. User invokes our extension's command to create a new C# project
3. We create the project in a folder then call `vscode.openFolder`
4. The folder opens, and some default files are opened in the editor

However step three kills the extension host process, so we cannot execute code for step four. Today, we skip the last step, which isn't a great experience for our users.
 
I have tried using `vscode.ExtensionContext.globalState` to hand off some startup state to the incoming extension instance, and while this does work there's some time before the documents open (several seconds), so the user can be surprised when documents open unannounced after they've started using the workspace.
 
I'm wondering what other options might exist. One idea is to create some configuration for the new workspace before opening it, so that it launches with the documents open immediately. I'm not sure how I'd do that though, or if it's even a viable idea.",https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251202,"feature-request, api, author-verification-requested, insiders-released"

It is great that with 1.100 the encoding API is finalized. I wanted to use it for an extension I am developing but I could not find a ""simple"" way to set the encoding of an open editor.

For files that are on disk, I am able to just use `window.openTextDocument` with the same URI and change the encoding through this.

For untitled files this is not possible, since I can't ""reopen"" an untitled file with it's URI. Would it be possible to introduce a general way to set the encoding of an editor? (IMO this also makes more sense)",https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251188,"bug, file-encoding, author-verification-requested, insiders-released, workbench-untitled-editors"

AI Assistant Limitation: Cannot see real-time terminal state but keeps trying to debug,"# AI Assistant Limitation: Cannot see real-time terminal state but keeps trying to debug

**Labels:** `documentation`, `user-experience`, `ai-behavior`

## Summary
GitHub Copilot Chat AI assistant has a fundamental limitation where it cannot see real-time terminal output, running processes, or current system state, but it repeatedly attempts to debug issues by running multiple terminal commands in a loop, wasting user time and creating frustration.

## Environment
- **AI Assistant**: GitHub Copilot Chat
- **User Interface**: VS Code Chat
- **Context**: Terminal debugging and Docker container troubleshooting

## Problem Description
When users encounter issues with running processes, containers, or scripts, the AI assistant cannot see what the user sees in their terminal. However, instead of acknowledging this limitation, the AI:

1. Repeatedly runs the same commands trying to ""catch"" different states
2. Attempts to debug by taking snapshots at different times
3. Makes assumptions about system state based on limited command output
4. Keeps trying variations of the same approach
5. Cannot see live logs, interactive prompts, or ongoing processes

## Specific Example
When troubleshooting a Docker container setup:
- User can see the container is running and working fine in their terminal
- AI repeatedly runs debugging commands like a person ""knocking on a door without seeing if anyone's home""
- AI tries `./test-script.sh debug` multiple times
- AI attempts to monitor logs with repeated commands
- AI cannot see that the issue is already resolved or working

## Root Cause
**Fundamental AI Limitation**: The AI assistant only receives text output after commands complete, not:
- Real-time process monitoring
- Live terminal streams
- Interactive prompts waiting for input
- Current system state
- Visual feedback users can see

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Have any issue with a running process or container
2. Ask AI assistant for help
3. Watch AI run multiple debugging commands in succession
4. Observe AI saying ""I cannot see what's happening"" while continuing to try
5. Notice AI making assumptions based on incomplete snapshots

## Expected Behavior
AI assistant should:
- Acknowledge its limitation upfront: ""I cannot see real-time terminal state""
- Ask user to describe what they see instead of running blind commands
- Provide guidance for user to run commands themselves
- Focus on providing solutions rather than attempting impossible debugging
- Be transparent about what it can and cannot observe

## Actual Behavior
AI assistant:
- Runs commands repeatedly without acknowledging limitations
- Attempts to debug issues it cannot actually observe
- Creates frustrating loops of failed debugging attempts
- Wastes user time with redundant command execution
- Does not leverage the user's ability to see what's actually happening

## Impact on User Experience
- **Frustration**: Users watch AI struggle with something they can clearly see
- **Time waste**: Multiple redundant debugging attempts
- **Confusion**: AI behavior doesn't match its stated capabilities
- **Inefficiency**: Focus on impossible debugging instead of solution guidance

## Suggested Solution
The AI should be programmed to:
1. **Acknowledge limitations immediately** when terminal debugging is needed
2. **Ask users to describe what they see** instead of running blind commands
3. **Provide step-by-step guidance** for users to execute themselves
4. **Focus on solution suggestions** rather than impossible observation attempts
5. **Be transparent** about the difference between command output and real-time state

## Additional Notes
This is not a technical bug but a fundamental behavioral issue with how AI assistants handle their observational limitations. Users can see live terminal output, process states, and system behavior that AI assistants simply cannot access, regardless of how many commands they run.

vs code hangs if you press Commit without a comment.,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Using GitHub extension.  
stage some changes and press Commit without enterning a comment. 

vs code hangs.  You have to quit out and restart it to get it to stop ""spinning"" .  You can't enter a comment and commit without restarting. 

This is super annoying and requires killing the Claude code session, for example. 

Expected:  Have an error message about no comment.  Then I could type the comment and press Commit again.

Feature Request: Native VS Code for iPad,"## Feature Request: Native VS Code for iPad

### Background

With Apple's latest iPadOS updates, iPad has gained significant desktop-class capabilities that make it a viable platform for professional development work:

- **Enhanced Multitasking**: Stage Manager and improved window management allow for true multi-window workflows
- **Advanced File Management**: Full external storage support, improved Files app, and desktop-like file operations
- **Professional Hardware**: M-series chips provide desktop-level performance, while accessories like Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil enhance productivity
- **Desktop-Class Features**: Better cursor support, keyboard shortcuts, and external display compatibility

### The Opportunity

These improvements have transformed iPad from a consumption device into a legitimate productivity platform. Many developers are already using iPad for auxiliary development tasks, but are limited by the lack of a proper IDE. A native VS Code for iPad would:

1. **Tap into a Growing Market**: iPad Pro users increasingly seek professional development tools
2. **Enable Mobile Development**: Perfect for on-the-go coding, code reviews, and quick fixes
3. **Complement Desktop Workflow**: Serve as a secondary development device or specialized tool for certain tasks
4. **Leverage iPad-Specific Features**: Touch interface for intuitive code navigation, Apple Pencil for annotations and sketches

### Proposed Features

- Native iPad app optimized for touch and Apple Pencil input
- Support for external keyboards and trackpads
- Multi-window support leveraging iPadOS capabilities
- Essential extensions marketplace
- Git integration and terminal access
- Seamless sync with desktop VS Code instances

The time is right for VS Code to embrace the iPad platform and lead the charge in mobile development environments.

Bring your own lang model is broken for Azure models,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I'm following this guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/language-models#_bring-your-own-language-model-key

Neither Azure OpenAI nor Azure AI Services models can be registered. The flow asks you to select a provider, I select Azure. Then it asks for the model ID, which I assume is the deployment name, so I provide that. Then it asks for deployment URL, and here's where it breaks. I can never go beyond this input prompt, it just gets stuck there.

Github Copilot is randomly deleting newline characters. When asked to fix, it apologises, fixes it and deletes another random new line character above the problematic line. It goes in a loop. @isidorn 

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Ask Claude 4 to refactor your code in Agent mode.

Detect and fix cyclic runtime dependencies,"*Background* historically we have never allowed to have cyclic runtime dependencies between our modules. The AMD loader would simply fail during load. Since the advent of ESM this has changed, browsers handle cycling dependencies graceful and things might work or not - it depends on the circumstances in which things get loaded (see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250990 for some fun). To prevent this madness, we have added a check for cyclic runtime dependencies (as part of the ESM work). Unfortunately, this check was broken and a couple of cyclic dependencies have slipped in. They should be cleaned-up ASAP

Since I use VSCode for a bunch of repos & languages, I like to install specific extensions per repo. The current best process to do this is:

1. Install extension
2. Disable extension
3. Enable extension for current workspace

I think it would be worthwhile to just add an option `Install (workspace)` for extensions that does this exact logic, but with one click instead of 3.",https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250987,*duplicate

When you guys gonna get your shit together with VSCode/Copilot?,"It's just utter mess and i really started to doubt you people even working on this... People is not gonna come here and give detailed issues everytime. we don't have to. We're not gonna spoon feed you everytime, just fix your garbage for once Microsoft, we are paying money to this crap!


1. LLM models performing worse. Same LLM's performing much better in other AI agent IDE's like Cursor. VScode just creating utter garbage code, hallucinations everytime, constant hangs, it attempts to edit code and does nothing on return.
2. Shitty models in Agent mode. Why we still have f*cking Sonnet 3.5? Google just released Gemini 06-05 few days ago and we still have 2.0 f*cking Flash... Wake up! They released 2.5 Flash and Pro 06-05
3. Every agent model is terrible except Sonnet 4 and it will work fine IF you're lucky. Other IDE's like Cursor have Opus 4 Agent from day one. I love in agent mode Gemini Pro just goes ahead and deletes 700 lines of code and it asks why it's not working anymore.
4. Getting rate limited because your shitty LLM's can't do shit i have to prompt them every f*cking time. And it says stuff like ""Ah, youre right let me fix the code"" and proceeds to fuck it up even more...

5. Where's AI features like Memory that helps you properly utilizing codebase, learns from it's mistakes. Proper Thinking modes. Obviously VSCode doesn't have them.",https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250975,triage-needed
Discrepancy in Trial Period: Request for Clarification,"
I'm shocked and disappointed to encounter issues with my Blackbox AI trial. I was informed that I had a 90-day trial period, but on my second day, the system is prompting me to purchase credits. I'd appreciate clarification on why this is happening so early. The discrepancy between what was communicated and the current situation feels concerning. Could you please look into this and provide a resolution?

In the Source Control panel, the “Commit” (✓) button remains active even when no commit message is provided. Clicking it triggers a Git commit that fails (as Git requires a non-empty message), but no clear error is shown in the UI. This can confuse users and appears to silently fail.

Expected Behavior:

Either the commit button should be disabled when no message is entered,
or

A warning or error should be shown when Git rejects the commit.

Steps to Reproduce:

Make a change to any tracked file.

Open the Source Control tab in VS Code.

Leave the commit message box empty.

Click the ✓ “Commit” button.

Observed Result:

Nothing appears to happen.

Commit silently fails.

No user-friendly message shown.

Expected Result:

Commit button should be disabled OR

Show a clear warning when Git rejects the commit.",https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250951,*duplicate

yeah i don't have large monitors and 32gb rams yet.
it will be really helpful for working on large related codebases even on smaller single monitor setup.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. define a task which use ""${relativeFile}"" for args 
{""label"": ""copy"",
  ""type"": ""process"",
  ""command"": ""scp"",
  ""args"": [
    ""${relativeFile}"",
    ""${config:sbparagraph.account.server}:${config:sbparagraph.account.path}/${fileBasename}""
   ]
}
 
4. start a Search 
5. save the search as a .code-search file
6. launch the task 'copy' on the .code-search opened file
7. you get : 
Executing task: C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\scp.EXE ..\..\..\..\Windows\system32 myserver:/mypath/. 

As you can see, ${fileBasename} == . (dot) and  ""${relativeFile}"" ==  ..\..\..\..\Windows\system32

"Invalid scheme returned by VSCode for MCP ""roots/list"" call from WSL","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

As said in the VSCode doc, we can indeed get the workspace folder using a MCP ""roots/list"" call.

However, VSCode returns a uri with thee scheme ""vscode-remote"", which is against the MCP spec (it can only be `file`):
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/client/roots

This crashes the official Python MCP SDK:
> validation error for ListRootsResult\nroots.0.uri\n  URL scheme should be 'file' [type=url_scheme, input_value='vscode-remote://wsl%2Bub...m/projects/mcptest', input_type=str]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/url_scheme""

The full JSON returned by the VSCode MCP client:
```json
{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":3,""result"":{""roots"":[{""uri"":""vscode-remote://wsl%2Bubuntu-22.04/home/m/projects/mcptest"",""name"":""mcptest""}]}}

Hello. I'd like for there to be a setting that lets you disable the behaviour where making a new line causes VSCode to re-arrange indentations across the entire file. I quite like how I indent things, I spend time manually adding indents to make things how I want them, and do not appreciate VSCode deciding otherwise without my consent.

**No, It's not 'Auto Indent', I disabled that and there were no changes.**
**Yes, I have 'Detect Indentation' disabled too.**

Here is a video of VSCode re-arranging my indentation when I made a new line.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03f738dc-fe78-499a-b936-eae60c11dd71

(You can put the video on loop to help with before and after comparisons).

This could _arguably_ be a bug report, but looking at how many documents I had to read just to complain that something is not working as expected made me consider that maybe this was actually a feature request after all.
I am asking for a whole new setting, so I'd call that a feature request.

I've asked on forums, and as far as I could tell, nobody knows if there is a setting for this.
Which means there probably isn't. Or if there is, it needs to be changed to be easier to find.
Though, I did receive a lot of constructive criticism about my code.",https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250906,"*caused-by-extension, *as-designed, settings-editor"
Authority-less MCP resources cannot be read by VS Code,"1. Announce a resource like `foo:///bar/baz.txt`

VS Code fails silently when no default browser is set — GitHub authentication hangs without fallback,"**Description:**
When no default browser is set in Windows 10 (e.g. user removed Edge and no other browser is configured), GitHub authentication in VS Code fails silently. The message `Signing in to github.com...` is shown indefinitely, and no fallback (like device code or manual URL copy) is presented to the user.

This results in complete authentication failure with no guidance.

---

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Use a Windows 10 machine where the default browser is missing or unassociated with the `https://` protocol.
2. Open VS Code.
3. Try to sign in to GitHub (e.g. by enabling Settings Sync or using `GitHub: Sign In`).
4. Observe: no browser is opened, and no manual fallback (device code or link) is shown. The process hangs.

---

**Expected behavior:**

* VS Code should detect the failure to launch a browser and:

  * Provide a clickable or copyable URL (`https://github.com/login/device`)
  * Show the device code
  * Offer fallback authentication options (like using a token)

---

**Actual behavior:**

* Browser launch fails with:

  ```
  ! Failed opening a web browser at https://github.com/login/device
    Application not found
  ```
* No fallback UI shown.
* Authentication hangs indefinitely.
